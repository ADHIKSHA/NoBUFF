# NoBUFF
A Live-Streaming Application in Django with Firebase. The videos are fetched from Firebase and loaded into the HTML page using VanillaJS. 
The videos are scheduled one after the other. 
Videos fetched are of high quality and each of 2 minute duration. The buffering is kept to the least and you can also schedule a google AD between the videos.

This could be a Video streaming facility like YouTube.
